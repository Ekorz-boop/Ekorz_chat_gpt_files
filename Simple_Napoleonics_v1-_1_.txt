•	Should have crew with different skills
•	Should have armor, firepower etc. stats
•	Positioning should matter

Gameplay Ideas
•	Players take turns commanding their tank platoon.
o	Command phase
	Issuse commands to your tanks (move turret etc.)
o	Spotting phase
	Try to spot one enemy tank (can only shoot spotted tanks)
o	Movement phase
	Roll to check if you can move and move 
o	Spotting phase
	Try to spot one enemy
o	Shooting phase
	If you spotted an enemy you may shoot at it (if you moved this turn you may only shoot if the tank have a stabilizer)
•	Platoon commander issues orders
•	Tank commanders follow the orders
•	Perform tasks, success vary depending on type of task and that crew members skill level
•	When shooting, hit different parts depending on gunner skill and dice roll



















Shooting
If a tank has spotted a target, and it’s in the tanks hit zone, it may attempt to shoot at it in the shooting phase. When attempting to shoot at a spotted target the player needs to make two rolls to check if it hits, and where it hits. 
To pass a hit test the gunner must succeed in rolling 2d6 under or at their skill in both targeting and accuracy. 
To check where the round hits, first roll 2d6 under their accuracy skill. If this succeeds you hit the desired spot. Secondly roll 2d6 under their targeting skill. If this succeeds you hit the tank in any spot (roll on random hit table). If this also fails, the hit is a bounce. A tank which is hit by a round anywhere, regardless of penetration or not, will automatically have -1 when trying to spot the tank which shot the round. 

Orders 
In the beginning of the round, the platoon commander tank issues orders to all tanks in the platoon via radio (if present, otherwise all tanks try to fulfill the objective they got designed at game start. The coordination skill determines how many tanks the platoon commander can actively command and issue new orders to. All excess tanks try to independently fulfill their tasks to the best of their ability as if they don’t have radio. 
A tank may request support from another tank, if so the other tank may ignore their objective to try to fulfill the support request. 
 
Turn Structure:
a.	Command Phase:
Players take turns commanding their tank platoons.
Issue commands to your tanks, such as adjusting turret position, changing targets, or preparing defensive maneuvers.
b.	Spotting Phase:
Each player attempts to spot one enemy tank. Only spotted tanks can be targeted and shot at.
c.	Movement Phase:
Players roll dice to determine if their tanks can move and then proceed to move their tanks accordingly.
d.	Spotting Phase:
Players have another opportunity to try to spot one enemy tank.
e.	Shooting Phase:
If a player has successfully spotted an enemy tank and their tank did not move during this turn, they may attempt to shoot at the spotted tank. Shooting is only allowed if the tank has a stabilizer after moving.
Platoon Commander Orders:
At the beginning of each round, the platoon commander issues orders to the tanks in the platoon via radio communication. The platoon commander can actively command and issue new orders to a limited number of tanks based on their coordination skill. Tanks without radios try to fulfill their objectives independently. Tanks can request support from other tanks, and the supporting tank may choose to ignore their objective to aid.
Crew and Tank Stats:
Tanks have different crew members with specific skills, including driver, gunner, loader, and commander. Each crew member has relevant skills that affect tank performance. Tanks have stats such as armor (different armor sections), firepower, speed, turret rotation speed, reload time, maximum ammo, and special attributes (e.g., night vision, thermal sights, radio, smoke launcher).
Task Performance:
Each tank has specific tasks or objectives assigned to them at the start of the game, such as capturing locations, destroying enemy tanks, providing reconnaissance, or protecting assets.Success in completing tasks varies depending on crew members' skill levels.Players roll dice and compare results to determine the outcome of each task.
Shooting Mechanics:
To shoot at a spotted enemy tank, the gunner must pass hit tests by rolling 2d6 under or equal to their targeting and accuracy skills. A successful hit determines the hit location by rolling 2d6 under the gunner's accuracy skill. If successful, the desired spot is hit. Otherwise, rolling 2d6 under the targeting skill determines a hit in a random spot. Tanks have different armor values for each section, affecting the success of penetrating the armor.
Commanders with Personalities:
Each platoon commander and tank commander have distinct personalities, traits, or special abilities. Personalities influence decision-making, leadership effectiveness, and potential bonuses or penalties for the platoon.
